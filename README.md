## Introduction
Here is a link of a cookbook which tests and shows how to use the python functions and modules which are curently implemented : 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Olaymka/Portfolio-Construction/blob/main/cookbook.ipynb#

This repository is dedicated to the progressive implementation and maintenance of various and state-to-the art techniques related to investment management decisions, portfolio construction and allocation techniques.

Please, know that I am still learning and do not hesitate to make constructive comments.  

## Contents
This project aims to cover the following aspects / areas: 
- Portfolio performance and risk indicators 
- Portfolio optimization techniques and methods
- Asset allocation strategies

## Features
- Portfolio performance and risk indicators which goes from *annaualized portfolio return and volatility, sharpe ratio* to *maximum drawdown, VaR, CVaR etc...*
 
- Classical portfolio optimization techniques: 
  - **Efficient risk portfolio:**
    This is the portfolio that gives you the optimal volatility/risk exposure given a targeted return. It comes from Harry Markowitz works and findings on the theory of portfolio management. Also known as mean-variance optimization, the idea is based on the mathematical existence of an optimal portfolio that offers the best risk/return trade-off. Based on the returns of the portfolio components or assets, optimal weightings can be calculated in order to build a portfolio with the best risk profile. Although the model looks good in theory, it has some shortcomings, such as its lack of robustness, which make it less effective in practice.
    
  - **Global minimum variance:**
    This is the portfolio that offers the lower possible return's variance. 
  - **Maximum sharpe ratio portfolio**
  - **Equally-weighted portfolio**
 
## To do / Improvement
This project is ongoing and there is still a lot to do in order to cover all aspects of portfolio management. Hereafter, some ideas / techniques and methods I will implement very soon: 
- Risk estimates techniques (covariance estimates)
- Expected returns estimates techniques
- Allocation strategies and techniques (CPPI, LDI...)
- Custom portfolio optimization
